## Numerical features of a single contiuous variables

```{r example-plot, fig.height = 1.3}
ggplot(some_df, aes(x1)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = "pink", color = "black") + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black", size = 2))
```


* A measure of **_central tendency_**, e.g. mean, median and mode.
* A measure of **_dispersion_** (also called variability or spread), e.g. variance, standard deviation and interquartile range.
* There are other measures, e.g. **_skewness_** and **_kurtosis_** that measures "tailedness", but these are not as common as the measures of first two. 
* The mean is also the _first moment_ and variance, skewness and kurtosis are _second, third, and fourth central moments_. 
* **Significance tests** or **hypothesis tests**: When testing for $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$ (often $\mu_0 = 0$), the $t$-test is commonly used if the underlying data are believed to be normally distributed.


## Outliers

**Outliers** are *observations* that are significantly different from the majority.
]


* Outliers can occur by chance in almost all distributions, but could be indicative of a measurement error, a different population, or an issue with the sampling process.
* Outlying values of independent variables are referred to as **high-leverage points**, although this distinction is not particularly important when analysing a single continuous variable.


## Closer look at the _boxplot_


```{r annotated-boxplot, fig.height = 3}
fn <- quantile(mtcars$wt, c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), type = 7)
iqr <- fn[4] - fn[2]
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, "")) + 
  geom_boxplot(size = 1.4, width = 0.2, outlier.color = "#006DAE",
               outlier.size = 3, outlier.fill = "#006DAE") + 
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "gray") + 
  annotate("line", x = fn[c(2,4)], y = 1.3, size = 1.3, color = "#C8008F") +
  annotate("segment", x = fn[c(2, 4, 3)], xend = fn[c(2,4, 3)],
           y = c(1.25, 1.25, 0.75), yend = c(1.35, 1.35, 0.9), size = 1.3, color = "#C8008F") +
  annotate("text", x = c(mean(fn[c(2, 4)]), fn[3]), y = c(1.4, 0.7), label = c("IQR", "median"), size = 10, color = "#C8008F") + 
  # some reason vline didn't work
  annotate("segment", x = c(fn[4] + 1.5 * iqr, fn[2] - 1.5 * iqr),  xend = c(fn[4] + 1.5 * iqr, fn[2] - 1.5 * iqr), y = -Inf, yend = Inf, linetype = "dashed") + 
  theme_void()
```


* Observations that are outside the range of lower to upper thresholds are referred at times as .monash-blue[outliers].
* Plotting boxplots for data from a skewed distribution will almost always show these "outliers" but these are not necessary outliers.
* Some definitions of outliers assume a symmetrical population distribution (e.g. in boxplots or observations a certain standard deviations away from the mean) and these definitions are ill-suited for asymmetrical distributions.


## Robust statistics: measure of central tendency

```{r robust-mean, fig.height = 3.5}
df <- tibble(x = rnorm(200) + c(rep(0, each = 195), rep(10, 5)))
ggplot(df, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(df$x),
             color = "#EE0220", size = 1.3) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(df$x),
             color = "#746FB2", size = 1.3) + 
  theme_void()
```


* **Mean** is a non-robust measure of location. 
* Some robust measures of locations are:
  * **Median** is the 50% quantile of the observations
  * **Trimmed mean** is the sample mean after discarding observations at the tails. 
  * **Winsorized mean** is the sample mean after replacing observations at the tails with the minimum or maximum of the observations that remain.

## Robust statistics: measure of dispersion

* **Standard deviation** or its square, **variance*, is a popular choice of measure of dispersion but is not robust to outliers. 
* Standard deviation for sample $x_1, ..., x_n$ is calculated as 
$$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$$
* Interquartile range is the difference between 1st and 3rd quartile and is more robust measure of spread than above.
* Median absolute deviance (MAD) is also more robust and defined as 
$$\text{median}(|x_i - \bar{x}|).$$



## Transformations

* Transformations to data are used as an attempt to stabilize the variance or make the data symmetrical.
* Log and square root transformations are popular.
* A range of $\lambda$ values for (one-parameter) Box-Cox transformation is sometimes used to test for optimal transformation:
$$y(\lambda) = \begin{cases}\dfrac{(y^\lambda - 1)}{\lambda}\\ \log(y)\end{cases}$$

Children and midparents heights 

```{r galton-data, include = FALSE}
data(galton, package = "UsingR")
df2 <- galton %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), 
               names_to = "person", 
               values_to = "height") 
```

:::

```{r galton-plot1, fig.width = 6.4}
ggplot(df2, aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ person, scale = "free") + 
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "Frequency")

```
```{r galton-plot2}
ggplot(df2, aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ person) + 
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "Frequency")
```

* Midparent's height is an average of the father's height and 1.08 times the mother's height. 
* The data contains 205 parents and 928 children.
```{r galtond-data-head}
galton %>% 
  arrange(parent, child) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  print(n = 3)
```
* The data included families of 1 to 15 children, so in the extreme case, one midparent data point is repeated 15 times in the data.
* The frequency of midparents heights therefore are over-represented with parents with large family size.

```{r galton-plot3, fig.width = 6.4}
ggplot(df2, aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, aes(y = stat(density))) + 
  facet_wrap(~ person) + 
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "Density")

```
```{r galton-plot4, fig.width = 6.4}
ggplot(df2, aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, aes(y = stat(density))) + 
  facet_wrap(~ person) + 
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "Density")
```


* Changing the bin width of histogram from 1 to 0.1, we can see the data have been rounded and hence some precision is lost in the data.
* The data confirms this with most children's height recorded with ".2" at the end and most midparents heights recorded with ".5" at the end.


```{r galton-plot5}
df2sum <- df2 %>% 
  group_by(person) %>% 
  summarise(med = median(height))

ggplot(df2, aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_grid(person ~ ., as.table = FALSE) + 
  geom_vline(data = df2sum, 
             aes(xintercept = med), 
             color = "red", size = 2) + 
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "Frequency")

```

```{r galton-plot6}
ggplot(df2, aes(height, person)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "")

```

* Aligning the histogram vertically makes it easier to compare the heights of children and midparents. 
* The side-by-side boxplots makes it easy to see the variability of the heights of the midparents are smaller than the children. 
* The smaller variability is expected because the midparents heights are average of two values.
* We can also see that the median height is larger for the midparents than children.
* You may think that the heights of children should be **_bimodal_**, _one peak for **male**_ and the _other peak for **female**_. But that is not necessary the case as we'll see next.

Self-reported heights 
```{r}
data("heights", package = "dslabs")

ggplot(heights, aes(height)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = sex), size = 2) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +

```{r dslabs-heights-2}
ggplot(heights, aes(height)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "#027EB6", size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "Density")

```

* You can see that drawing separate density plots for each sexes shows that the women are on average shorter than men.
* The bimodality is however not visible when the data are combined.

Men's heights

```

```{r pearson-height-plot3, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(df4, aes(height, status)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "")

```

* The height distribution of the son appears more normal than of the father looking at the density plot.
* Looking at the Q-Q plots, this however looks the other way around.
* The heights are recorded to five decimal places (e.g. `65.04851`). 
* It's unlikely that the heights were measured to such high precision and rather that someone must have "jittered" the data (i.e. added some small random perturbation to the observation).

* Thre is a large frequency in the final bin.
* There is a decline in observations in the $40-49K range as well as dip in observations around $26K and $34K.
* The histogram is using a bin width of 1 unit and is **left-open** (or **right-closed**): (4.5, 5.5], (5.5, 6.5] ... (49.5, 50.5].
* Occasionally, whether it is left- or right-open can make a difference.

## Categorical variables

There are two types of categorical variables:

* **Nominal** where there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories. E.g. blue, grey, black, white.
* **Ordinal** where there is a clear order to the categories. E.g. Strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree.

### Categorical factors un R

* In R, categorical variables may be encoded as **factors**.
```{r factors, echo = TRUE}
data <- c(2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1)
factor(data)
```
* You can easily change the labels of the variables:
```{r factor-labels, echo = TRUE}
factor(data, labels = c("I", "II", "III"))
```
* Order of the factors are determined by the input:

```{r factor-input, echo = TRUE}
# numerical input are ordered in increasing order #<<
factor(c(1, 3, 10))
# character input are ordered alphabetically #<<
factor(c("1", "3", "10"))
# you can specify order of levels explicitly #<<
factor(c("1", "3", "10"),  levels = c("1", "3", "10"))
```
### Numerical factors in R

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
x <- factor(c(10, 20, 30, 10, 20))
mean(x)
```

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> `as.numeric` function returns the internal integer values of the factor
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(as.numeric(x))
```

You probably want to use:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(as.numeric(levels(x)[x]))
```
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(as.numeric(as.character(x)))
```


### Example: German Bundestag Election 2009

```{r btw2009-data, include = FALSE}
data("btw2009", package = "flexclust")
east <- c("Brandenburg", "Mecklenburg-Vorpommern", "Sachsen",
          "Sachsen-Anhalt", "Thueringen")
df1 <- btw2009 %>%  
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(voters = sum(eligible) / 1e6) %>% 
  mutate(loc = ifelse(state %in% east, "East", "West"))
```

```{r btw2009-plot1, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 5.1}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(voters, state)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "Voters (millions)", y = "") 

```

```{r btw2009-plot2, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 5.1}
df1 %>% 
  mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, voters)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(voters, state)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "Voters (millions)", y = "") 

```

```{r btw2009-plot3, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 5.1}

  ggplot(aes(voters, state)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "Voters (millions)", y = "") + 
  facet_grid(loc ~ ., scale = "free_y") 
  
```

## Order nominal variables meaningfully

<i class="fas fa-code"></i> **Coding tip**: use below functions to easily change the order of factor levels

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
stats::reorder(factor, value, mean)
forcats::fct_reorder(factor, value, median)
forcats::fct_reorder2(factor, value1, value2, func)
```

## Example: Aspirin use after heart attack

```{r meta-data, include = FALSE}
data("Fleiss93", package = "meta")
df8 <- Fleiss93 %>% 
  mutate(total = n.e + n.c)
```

```{r meta-plot1}
df8 %>% 
  mutate(study = fct_reorder(study, desc(total))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(study, total)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") + 
  guides(x = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))

```

```{r meta-plot2}
df8 %>% 
  mutate(study = ifelse(total < 2000, "Other", study),
         study = fct_reorder(study, desc(total))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(study, total)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") 

```

* Meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies.
* This data studies the use of aspirin for death prevention after myocardial infarction, or in plain terms, a heart attack.
* The ISIS-2 study has more patients than all other studies combined.
* You could consider lumping the categories with low frequencies together.

## Consider combining factor levels with low frequencies

<i class="fas fa-code"></i> **Coding tip**: the following family of functions help to easily lump factor levels together:

```{r fct_lump, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
forcats::fct_lump()
forcats::fct_lump_lowfreq()
forcats::fct_lump_min()
forcats::fct_lump_n()
forcats::fct_lump_prop()
# if conditioned on another variable
ifelse(cond, "Other", factor)
dplyr::case_when(cond1 ~ "level1",
                 cond2 ~ "level2",
                 TRUE ~ "Other")
```

## Anorexia

```{r anorexia-data, include = FALSE}
data(anorexia, package = "MASS")

df9tab <- table(anorexia$Treat) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rename(Treatment = Var1, Frequency = Freq)

```

```{r anorexia-plot1}
ggplot(anorexia, aes(Treat)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") 

```
```{r anorexia-plot2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(anorexia, aes(Treat)) + 
  stat_count(geom = "point", size = 4) +
  stat_count(geom = "line", group = 1) +
  labs(y = "Frequency", x = "")
```

* This can be appropriate depending on what you want to communicate. 
* A barplot occupies more area compared to a point and the area does a better job of communicating size.
* A line is suggestive of a trend. 


`geom_bar` or `geom_col`?

```{r eg, echo = TRUE}
df <- data.frame(var = c("F", "F", "M", "M", "F"))
dftab <- as.data.frame(table(df$var))

df
dftab
```

## Titanic

```{r titanic-data, include = FALSE}
df9 <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

```{r titanic-plot1, fig.height = 1.7, fig.width = 4}
df9 %>% 
  group_by(Class) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, total)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#ee64a4") + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") 

```
```{r titanic-plot2, fig.height = 1.7, fig.width = 3}
df9 %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Sex, total)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#746FB2") + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") 

```

```{r titanic-plot3, fig.height = 1.7, fig.width = 3}
df9 %>% 
  group_by(Age) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Age, total)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#C8008F") + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") 

```

```{r titanic-plot4, fig.height = 1.7, fig.width = 3}
df9 %>% 
  group_by(Survived) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Survived, total)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#795549") + 
  labs(x = "Survived", y = "Frequency") 

```

**What does the graphs for each categorical variable tell us?**

* There were more crews than 1st to 3rd class passengers
* There were far more males on ship; possibly because majority of crew members were male. You can further explore this by constructing two-way tables or graphs that consider both variables.
* Most passengers were adults. 
* More than two-thirds of passengers died. 


## Coloring bars

```{r, fig.width = 10}
g1 <- df9 %>% 
  group_by(Class) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, total)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") 

g2 <- df9 %>% 
  group_by(Class) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, total)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#006DAE") + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") + 
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative()

g3 <- df9 %>% 
  group_by(Class) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, total)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = Class)) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Frequency") + 
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative()

g1 + g2 + g3
```


* Colour here doesn't add information as the x-axis already tells us about the categories, but colouring bars can make it more visually appealing. 
* If you have too many categories colour won't work well to differentiate the categories. 


## Opinion poll in Ireland Aug 2013

```{r poll-data, include = FALSE}
df11 <- tibble(party = c("Fine Gael", "Labour", "Fianna Fail",
                         "Sinn Fein", "Indeps", "Green", "Undecided"),
               nos = c(181, 51, 171, 119, 91, 4, 368)) 
df11v2 <- df11 %>% filter(party != "Undecided")
df11
```

```{r poll-plot1, fig.width = 7}
g11 <- df11 %>% 
  ggplot(aes("", nos, fill = party)) + 
  geom_col(color = "black") + 
  labs(y = "", x = "") + 
  coord_polar("y") +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.line.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(name = "Party")
g11

```

```{r poll-plot2, fig.width = 7}
g11 %+% df11v2 + 
  # below is needed to keep the same color scheme as before
  scale_fill_manual(values = qualitative_hcl(7)[1:6])

```

* Pie chart is popular in mainstream media but are not generally recommended as people are generally poor at comparing angles.
* 3D pie charts should definitely be avoided!
* Here you can see that there are many people that are "Undecided" for which political party to support and failing to account for this paints a different picture. 


Piechart is a stacked barplot just with a transformed coordinate system


```{r barplot, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3}
df <- data.frame(var = c("A", "B", "C"), perc = c(40, 40, 20))
g <- ggplot(df, aes("", perc, fill = var)) + 
  geom_col()
g
```
```{r piechart, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3}
g + coord_polar("y")
```

Roseplot is a barplot just with a transformed coordinate system

```{r nonstacked-barplot, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 10}
dummy <- data.frame(var = LETTERS[1:20], 
                 n = round(rexp(20, 1/100)))
g <- ggplot(dummy, aes(var, n)) + geom_col(fill = "pink", color = "black")
g
```

```{r roseplot, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3}
g + coord_polar("x") + theme_void()
```
